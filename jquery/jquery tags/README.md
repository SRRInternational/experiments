## Usage

- The input field with the ID `input-tags` is turned into a tag input by Selectize.js.
- Users can input tags separated by the specified delimiter (`,` in this example).
- The `persist` option is set to `false`, meaning tags are not persisted after the user leaves the input field.
- The `create` option allows users to create new tags by typing them into the input field.

Feel free to customize this example based on your project requirements. Visit the Selectize.js documentation for more configuration options and features.
