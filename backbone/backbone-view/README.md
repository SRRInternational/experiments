## Backbone.js Dynamic List Example
This repository showcases a simple HTML file utilizing Backbone.js to dynamically load and render a list of items. The list is populated with data from a Backbone model, and a button triggers the rendering process.

### Usage
1. Include the required libraries in your HTML file:
    - jQuery 3.6.0
    - jQuery UI 1.13.1
    - Underscore.js 1.3.3
    - Backbone.js 0.9.2
2. Create a Backbone model with the desired data structure. 
3. Define a Backbone view responsible for rendering the data dynamically when triggered by a user action.
4. Instantiate the view with the model to observe the dynamic list generation.

### Features
- **Load Button:** Clicking the "Load" button triggers the rendering of a dynamic list based on the data provided in the Backbone model.
- **Dynamic List:** The list is dynamically created by cloning a template and updating its content with data from the Backbone model.
